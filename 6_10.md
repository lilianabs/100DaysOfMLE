## Day 6

I started learning about how to parallelize functions using [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parallel.html). To test the package, I wrote the following code:

```python
import time
import numpy as np
from math import sqrt
from joblib import Parallel, delayed

start = time.time()
res = [sqrt(i ** 2) for i in range(10)]
print('Duration operation with Python list: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))

start = time.time()
res = np.sqrt(np.square(np.arange(10)))
print('Duration operation with Numpy array: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))

start = time.time()
res = Parallel(n_jobs=-1)(delayed(sqrt)(i ** 2) for i in range(10))
print('Duration operation with joblib: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))
```

>Note: I looks like numpy is fast enough but using joblib improves the timing a bit. I plan to use this package to parallelize some functions of the [ml-library](https://github.com/lilianabs/ml-library) I'm working on. 

## Day 7

From today onwards, I'll try to solve SQL questions daily. I found [Tina Huang strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaD3ZFFNwhM) very useful. I'll start working on the [SQLZoo problems](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial).
