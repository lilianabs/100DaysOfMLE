## Day 1

I read this great post [How to Structure a Data Science Project for Readability and Transparency](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-structure-a-data-science-project-for-readability-and-transparency-360c6716800) to learn more about how to structure ML projects. More specifically, I learned about Poetry and how to check issues before commiting.  


## Day 2

I read this post [What is Machine Learning System Design Interview and How to Prepare for It](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-machine-learning-system-design-interview-and-how-to-prepare-for-it-537d1271d754). It provides a template for answering Machine Learning system design questions during an interview. Also, I read this other post [https://medium.com/codex/testing-software-code-a-python-practical-guide-5b92b79879b5](https://medium.com/codex/testing-software-code-a-python-practical-guide-5b92b79879b5) which gave me lots of great ideas on how to write end to end tests for a ML pipeline.
