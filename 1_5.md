## Day 1

I read this great post [How to Structure a Data Science Project for Readability and Transparency](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-structure-a-data-science-project-for-readability-and-transparency-360c6716800) to learn more about how to structure ML projects. . More specifically, I learned about Poetry and how to check issues before commiting.
