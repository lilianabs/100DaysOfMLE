## Day 1

I read this great post [How to Structure a Data Science Project for Readability and Transparency](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-structure-a-data-science-project-for-readability-and-transparency-360c6716800) to learn more about how to structure ML projects. More specifically, I learned about Poetry and how to check issues before commiting.  


## Day 2

I read this post [What is Machine Learning System Design Interview and How to Prepare for It](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-machine-learning-system-design-interview-and-how-to-prepare-for-it-537d1271d754). It provides a template for answering Machine Learning system design questions during an interview. Also, I read this other post [https://medium.com/codex/testing-software-code-a-python-practical-guide-5b92b79879b5](https://medium.com/codex/testing-software-code-a-python-practical-guide-5b92b79879b5) which gave me lots of great ideas on how to write end to end tests for a ML pipeline.

## Day 3

I started working on my own Machine Learning library to review all of the concepts and try to implement them on my own. I followed the tutorial [How to create a Python library](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-create-a-python-library-7d5aea80cc3f) to create the project for the library.

Today, I also discovered this greate [template for a model card](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning_models/Model_card_template).

## Day 4

In this day, I found an intesting [project](https://medium.com/@lorenagongang/sentiment-analysis-on-streaming-twitter-data-using-kafka-spark-structured-streaming-python-part-b27aecca697a) that performs sentiment analysis to Twitter data. It gave me the idea of using the lexicon approach to look for hate speech or compare the approach with the labels of the [syntetic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usharengaraju/dynamically-generated-hate-speech-dataset).
